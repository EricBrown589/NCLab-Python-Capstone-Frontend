A local Angular UI for managing Magic: The Gathering cards and decks.
This frontend communicates with the companion Flask REST API to fetch, manage, and display card/deck data.

This project was created as part of a capstone project and is still a work in progress.

Backend repo: ðŸ‘‰ [MTG Card & Deck Manager API](https://github.com/EricBrown589/NCLab-Python-Capstone-Backend)

## Features

* Cards
  * Browse all cards with client-side filters (colors, type)
  * Add cards by exact name (via backend â†’ Scryfall API)
  * Update amount_owned
  * Delete cards (only when amount_owned = 0)
* Decks
  * Create and delete decks
  * Add cards to decks (by name)
  * View all cards in a deck
* Quality of Life
  * Responsive UI built in Angular
  * Instant UI updates when data changes (Angular change detection)
 
## Requirements

* Angular CLI: 20.1.5
* Node.js: 22.18.0
* npm: 10.9.3
* A running backend API at ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/``` (Flask with CORS enabled)

Install frontend dependencies: ```npm install```

## How to Run Locally

1. Start the backend (Flask API)
    * Follow setup in the backend README
    * Ensure it runs at ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/```
2. Start the frontend
    * ```npm install```
    * ```npm start``` or ```ng serve```

Open: ðŸ‘‰ ```http://localhost:4200/```

```

## Future Work / Roadmap

Planned Improvement:
* Better search/filter controls
* Support searching and returning multiple matches
* Clearer error messages
* Create an interactive and enjoyable home/landing page
* Add styling throughout to create a fun and welcoming application

Long-Term Ideas:
* Adding authentication and users
* Deploying and hosting somewhere

## Known Issues / Limitations

* Home/Landing page is blank
* Cards can only be deleted when amount_owned = 0
* Multi-faced cards are not fully supported yet
* Image sizes from Scryfall can be inconsistent
* Can only retrieve a card from Scryfall by exact name
* Minimal client-side validation (relies on backend rules)
* Can not easily add multiple of the same card to a deck
* Can not remove cards from a deck

## Status

Features and UI are subject to change as development continues
